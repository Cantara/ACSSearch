# HOW TO USE THIS FILE 
#
# This file should be copied to the same folder as schema.xml Solr-configuration.
# E.g. /home/solr/solr/collection1/conf/
# 
# In schema.xml, add the following line after the tokenizer for fieldtype edge_ngram
# <filter class="solr.SynonymFilterFactory" synonyms="acs_synonyms.txt" ignoreCase="true" expand="false"/> 


# EXPLANATION
#
# Real synonyms
#
# If you want two (or more) search word to return the same results, add them to this file in this way:
# word1 => word2
#
# Special character "synonyms"
#
# Special characters are ignored by default in Solr.
# In order for Solr to recognize terms containing special characters, we define a list of terms and their "synonyms"
# & (ampersands) are escaped in the Django template which renders the text-body of the Solr-index to prevent XSS attacks.
# Therefore one must use &amp; in place of & when creating such synonyms.
# E.g. R&D, R&amp;D => researchanddevelopment
